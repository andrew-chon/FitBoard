# FitBoard
The goal for this project was to create a social media site where groups of friends come together and to complete motivate each other to workout. Friends "buy-in" to a pot and win by checking in to the gym the most number of times within a given time frame.  They do that by taking a selfie at the gym to prove they were there.

The project uses Node.js for its backend and a MySQL database.  The frontend is powered by jQuery.
